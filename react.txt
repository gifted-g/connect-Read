Creating a Basic Skeleton
Fire up your terminal and type in the following command:
create-react-native-app HouseShare
...
...
...
Success! Created HouseShare at /Users/abhisheknalwaya/Documents/book/
HouseShareInside that directory, you can run several commands:
yarn start
Starts the development server so you can open your React Native app in the Expo
application on your phone.
yarn run ios
(Mac only, requires Xcode)
Starts the development server and loads your app in an iOS simulator.
yarn run android
(Requires Android build tools)
Starts the development server and loads your app on a connected Android device or
emulator.
yarn test
Starts the test runner.
yarn run eject
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files, and scripts
into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!
We suggest that you begin by typing this:
cd HouseShare
yarn start
Happy hacking!
